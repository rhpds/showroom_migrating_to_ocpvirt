== Virtual Machine Management

=== Controlling virtual machine state

As a user with permission to access virtual machine, you can stop, start, restart, pause, and unpause virtual machines from the web console.

. In the left menu, go back to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines*:

. Select the _Virtual Machine_ `fedora02` from the list.

. Press the top-right dropdown, *Actions*, to list the available 
options:
+

+
.. *Stop*: Starts a graceful shutdown of the _Virtual Machine_.
.. *Restart*: This will send a signal to the operating system to reboot the _Virtual Machine_. Guest integrations are needed for this to work properly.
.. *Pause*: The process is frozen without further access to CPU resources and I/O, but the memory used by the VM at the hypervisor level will stay allocated.

. Press *Stop* and wait till the _Virtual Machine_ is in state `Stopped`.

. Clicking on *Actions*, the option *Start* appears, and the options *Restart* and *Pause* are greyed out.

. Press *Start*, and wait for the `Running` status.

. Using the *Actions* menu, press the *Pause* option. The _Virtual Machine_ state will change to `Paused`.

. Unpause the _Virtual Machine_ using *Actions* and the option *Unpause*.

=== Live Migrate a Virtual Machine

In this section, we will migrate the VM from one OpenShift node to another without shutting down the VM. Live migration requires on `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) storage so that the VM disks can be mounted on both the source and destination nodes at the same time. OpenShift Virtualization, unlike other virtualization solutions, does not use monolithic datastores mounted to each cluster member that hold many VM disks for many different VMs. Instead, each VM disk is stored in its own volume that is only mounted when and where it's needed. 

. Navigate to the *Details* tab to see where the worker node is running:

. Using the menu *Actions*, press *Migrate*
+

. After a few seconds, the VM will change the status to `Migrating`. A few seconds later, it will return to the `Running` status, but on a different node. The VM has been successfully live migrated!

=== Resize a Virtual Machine

It is possible to change the resources such as CPU and Memory associated to a _Virtual Machine_ after it is created. 

. In the *Details* tab press in the configuration under `CPU | Memory`
+
image::_images/Pods_Migration/35_VM_Resources.png[]

. A dialog will appear to specify new values for the _CPU_ and _Memory_.
+
image::_images/Pods_Migration/36_VM_Resources_Dialog.png[]

. Update the _CPU cores_ to `2` and the _Memory_ to `3 GiB` and press *Save*.

. Scrolling up, the _Virtual Machine_ will show this message indicating it has to be rebooted to apply the changes.

. Using the *Actions* menu, press *Restart* to reboot the instance.


== Summary

In this lab, you explored the Pods associated with the VM and you ran commands inside the container to explore the associated storage and network interfaces. Finally, you ran a migration test on the VM that you previously created to watch it move from one worker node to another without shutting down (live migration).
