== Environment Overview and OpenShift Virtualization Operator Review

:numbered:

== Introduction to Operator Installation

In this lab, you review the OpenShift operator that is used to install Red Hat^(R)^ OpenShift^(R)^ Virtualization for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

.Goals
* Become familiar with the cluster requirements for Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization
* Explore the nodes and machines in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster
* Gain experience with Operator installation using the OperatorHub
* Examine the installed Operator and the PersistentVolumeClaim created by the Operator

== Review Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Cluster

=== Supported Platforms

* On-premises bare metal servers. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/installing/installing_bare_metal/preparing-to-install-on-bare-metal.html#virt-planning-bare-metal-cluster-for-ocp-virt_preparing-to-install-on-bare-metal[Planning a bare metal cluster for OpenShift Virtualization]
* Amazon Web Services bare metal instances. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.html#installing-aws-customizations[Installing a cluster on AWS with customizations.] for details.
[NOTE]

====
Installing OpenShift Virtualization on IBM CloudÂ® Bare Metal Servers is a Technology Preview feature only.
====
* IBM Cloud Bare Metal Servers. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6738731[Deploy OpenShift Virtualization on IBM Cloud Bare Metal Nodes] for details.
+
[NOTE]
====
OpenShift Virtualization is also supported on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) Classic clusters, which have the same configuration requirements as AWS bare-metal clusters.

=== Verify Requirements

Before you install OpenShift Virtualization for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, make sure that your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster meets the following requirements:

* CPU requirements
** Supported by Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9
** Support for AMD and Intel 64-bit architectures (x86-64-v2).
** Support for Intel 64 or AMD64 CPU extensions.
** Intel VT or AMD-V hardware virtualization extensions enabled.
** NX (no execute) flag enabled
* Storage requirements
** Supported by OpenShift Container Platform
** Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation: You must create a dedicated storage class for Windows virtual machine disks. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6978371[Optimizing ODF PersistentVolumes for Windows VMs] for details.

* Operating system requirements
** Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) installed on worker nodes
+
[NOTE]
If your cluster uses worker nodes with different CPUs, live migration failures can occur because different CPUs have different capabilities. 

=== Review Nodes and Machines

. Navigate to {ocp_url}[window=_blank] and login with user `admin` and password `{ocp_password}`
. From the navigation menu, select *Compute* -> *Nodes*:
+

+
There are three control plane and three workers in the OpenShift Cluster. In addition, the `ipmi` (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is being used to manage the bare-metal nodes.

. Click a worker node to obtain resource information about the node, and navigate to the *Details* tab to review the information about the operating system:
+
image::_images/Install/Worker0_Information.png[]
+
The bare-metal node is configured using Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS.

. Select *Compute* -> *Bare Metal Hosts*:
+

+
[NOTE]
Ignore the "Registration error" message if it appears.

. Click a worker node to obtain information about the physical (bare-metal) node:
+

+
[NOTE]
Ignore the "Registration error" message if it appears.


== Examine OpenShift Virtualization Operator

To save time to perform the lab tasks, the operator was preinstalled for you.

. Navigate to *Operator* -> *Installed Operators* and select *OpenShift Virtualization*. If you don't see it you may need to switch to *All Projects* in the Projects drop down menu.

. Click the *Details* tab to view information about the Operator:
+
image::_images/Install/11_Details_1.png[]

. Scroll down to the *ClusterServiceVersion details* section and review the details:
+
image::_images/Install/11_Details_2.png[]
+
You can see the `Namespace` where the Operator was installed, operator status, operator `Deployments` created during installation, operator `ServiceAccounts`, and the `OperatorGroup`.

. Scroll up and click the *Subscription* tab to view the subscription details:
+
image::_images/Install/12_Subscription.png[]
+
[NOTE]
Subscribing an Operator to one or more namespaces makes the Operator available to developers on your cluster.

== Examine PersistentVolumeClaims created by the Operator

During the installation of the Operator, some `VolumeSnapshots` for different Linux distributions are created:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0+
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0
* Fedora
* CentOS 7
* CentOS Stream 8
* CentOS Stream 9

In this section, you examine the PVCs created by the Operator.

In the left menu, navigate to *Storage* and click *VolumeSnapshots*. From the project dropdown select `All Projects`

//image::_images/Install/13_PVC_NS.png[]
image::_images/Install/13_VS_NS.png[]

[IMPORTANT]
Depending of the Storage used, the images can be `PersistentVolumeClaims` instead `VolumeSnapshots``. This lab is using _ODF_, which in latest versions of *OpenShift Virtualization* is using the Volume Snapshots feature. 
[NOTE]
Use volume snapshots on a storage profile that is proven to scale better when cloning from a single snapshot.
