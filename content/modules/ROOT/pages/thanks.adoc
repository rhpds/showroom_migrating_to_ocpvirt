Thanks for attending to this session. 

During this session you learned the basics of OpenShift Virtualization. You also learned how to create and administrate Virtual Machines.

Migrating to OpenShift Virtualization using the Migration Toolkit Virtualizatopn operator makes the task easy and allows to perform bulk migrations. It is also possible to migrate VMs from other virtualization platforms and upload the exported disk images in an easy way.
