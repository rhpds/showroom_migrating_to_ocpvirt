== Introduction to Storage Management 

Red Hat OpenShift supports multiple types of storage, both for on-premises and cloud providers. OpenShift Virtualization can use any supported container storage interface (CSI) provisioner in the environment you're running on. For example, OpenShift Data Foundation, NetApp, Dell/EMC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Pure Storage, Portworx, and many others support on-premises, CSI provisioned, ReadWriteMany (RWX) volumes with OpenShift Virtualization.

This workshop segment will explore Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), which are used to request storage from the provider and store a VM disk. Many storage providers also support snapshots and clones of their devices, be sure to check with your vendor to verify the features supported by the CSI driver and storage device.

Notably, there are no restrictions on storage protocol (e.g. NFS, iSCSI, FC, etc.) specific to OpenShift Virtualization. The only requirement is that the RWX access mode is available for live migration. Otherwise, the storage that best meets the needs of your VMs and applications is always the right choice.

== Snapshots

=== Introduction

OpenShift Virtualization relies on the CSI storage provider's snapshot capability to create disk snapshots for the virtual machine, which can be taken "online" while the VM is running or "offline" while the VM is powered off. If the KVM integrations are installed to the VM, you will also have the option of quiescing the guest operating system (quiescing ensures that the snapshot of the disk represents a consistent state of the guest file systems, e.g., buffers are flushed and the journal is consistent).

Since disk snapshots are dependent on the storage implementation, abstracted by CSI, performance impact and capacity used will depend on the storage provider. Work with your storage vendor to determine how the system will manage PVC snapshots and the impact they may or may not have.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Snapshots, by themselves, are not a backup or disaster recovery capability. The data needs to be protected in other ways, such as one or more copies stored in a different location, to recover from the storage system failing.

In addition to the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP), partners such as Kasten by Veeam, Trilio, and Storware support the ability to backup and restore virtual machines to the same cluster or other clusters as needed.

// AC - Perhaps a comment about advanced snapshot or cloning features provided by storage class and CSI drivers?

With the VM snapshots feature, cluster administrators and application developers can:

* Create a new snapshot
* List all snapshots attached to a specific VM
* Revert a VM to a snapshot
* Delete an existing VM snapshot

=== Operate with Snapshots

. Navigate back to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines* and select the vm `fedora02` in the project `vmexamples`
+

. Navigate to the *Snapshots* tab
+
image::_images/Storage/10_VM_Snapshots_Tab.png[]

. Press *Take snapshot* and a dialog will open
+
[NOTE]
There is a warning about the `cloudinitdisk` not being included in the snapshot. This is expected and happens because it is an ephemeral disk.
+
image::_images/Storage/11_VM_Snapshot_Dialog.png[]

. Use `fedora02-snap` as the snapshot name.
. Press *Save* and wait till the _Snapshot_ has been created and the *status* shows as `Succeeded`
+
image::_images/Storage/12_VM_Snapshot_Taken.png[]

. Press the three dots and check that the *Restore* option is greyed out because the VM is running
+
image::_images/Storage/13_VM_Restore_Disabled.png[]

. Switch to the *Console* tab to perform a modification to your running VM. This small modification will break your VM, and it won't be able to boot anymore.
+
Log in with the user `fedora` and password `ocpVirtIsGre@t` (or whatever you used in the previous module). Execute the command:
+
[source,sh]
----
[fedora@fedora02 ~]$ sudo rm -rf /boot/grub2; sudo shutdown -r now
----

. The _Virtual Machine_ will not be able to boot. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
In the previous step, the operating system was shutdown from within the guest. However, OpenShift Virtualization will restart it automatically by default. This behavior can be changed globally or on a per-VM basis.
+

. Using the *Actions* dropdown menu, stop the _Virtual Machine_. Wait until the VM is stopped.

. Navigate back to the *Snapshots* tab and press *Restore* on the previously created snapshot.
+
image::_images/Storage/15_VM_Restore.png[]

. In the dialog shown, press *Restore*
+
image::_images/Storage/16_VM_Restore_Dialog.png[]

. Wait until the VM is restored, and then start the VM 
+
image::_images/Storage/17_VM_Restored.png[]

. Verify that the VM is booting correctly again.
+

== Clone a Virtual Machine

Cloning creates a new VM that uses its disk image for storage, but most of the clone's configuration and stored data is identical to the source VM.

. Press *Clone* from the *Actions* menu, and a dialog will open
+
image::_images/Storage/19_VM_Clone_Dialog.png[]
+
[NOTE]
Notice the VM, if is powered on, it will be stopped to perform the clone. If you have a snapshot of the VM, you can also create a clone from the snapshot without powering off the VM.

. Leave the defaults and click *Clone*.
. A new VM is created, the disks are cloned and automatically the portal will redirect you to the new VM.
+
image::_images/Storage/20_VM_Cloned.png[]
+
[IMPORTANT]
The cloned VM will have the same identity as the source VM, which may cause conflicts with applications and other clients interacting with the VM. Use caution when cloning a VM connected to an external network or in the same project.

== Summary

In this module, you have learned the basics concepts of storage on OpenShift, as well as reviewed how OpenShift Virtualization will automatically download and create boot sources for some guest operating systems. Furthermore, you have performed tasks related to the storage to the VM, such as creating snapshots, restoring a snapshot, and cloning a virtual machine.

=== Glossary of terms

*Container Storage Interface (CSI)*: An API specification for the management of container storage across different container orchestration (CO) systems. An OpenShift cluster can have many CSI provisioners from different vendors, and each VM can use storage from multiple vendors without conflicts.

*Dynamic Provisioning*: The storage framework allows you to create  volumes on-demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision persistent storage. Each VM disk is stored in a dynamically created storage volume at a 1:1 ratio.

*Persistent volumes (PV)*: OpenShift Virtualization uses the Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) framework to allow cluster administrators to provision persistent storage for a cluster. VMs use a _PVC_ to request PV resources without having specific knowledge of the underlying storage infrastructure.

*Persistent volume claims (PVCs)*: A _PVC_ is a request for storage capacity and, when bound to a PV, how the system knows which storage volume to mount for the VM. As a VM user, you're able to use the storage without knowing the details of the underlying infrastructure environment.

*Storage class*: A _storage class_ provides a way for administrators to describe the classes of storage they offer, for example, "gold," "silver," and "bronze". Different classes might map to quality of service levels, backup policies, and arbitrary policies determined by the cluster administrators. These will be specific to your storage vendor.
