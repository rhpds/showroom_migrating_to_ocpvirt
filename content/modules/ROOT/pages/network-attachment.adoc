== Introduction to Network Attachment

By default, all virtual machines are attached to the OpenShift software-defined network (SDN), which enables access from other workloads on the OpenShift cluster, including other VMs and any OpenShift native applications.

* The SDN provides additional features for abstracting, connecting, and exposing applications in a controlled manner, whether deployed as VMs or Pods in the cluster. These include the `Service` and `Route` features of OpenShift.
* OpenShift's network policy engine allows the VM user or administrator to create rules which allow or deny network traffic to and from individual VMs or entire projects/namespaces.

However, virtual machines may also connect directly to one or more external networks, such as VLANs, when needed. This is in addition to the SDN, which means that, for example, the administrator can connect to the VM from an external IP address, but the application communicates across the SDN with other VMs hosted by OpenShift Virtualization.

At a high level, this is done by configuring the host networking, such as creating a mode 4 (LACP) bond and a Linux bridge on top. This workshop segment will walk through the next step in that process, creating a network attachment definition to allow VMs to connect to that bridge and, therefore, directly to the external network. 

.Goals
* Create a Linux^(R)^ Bridge on worker nodes
* Create a network attachment definition

== Review NMstate operator

To save time to perform all the tasks, NMState Operator was preinstalled for you.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* and select *Kubernetes NMstate Operator*. You may need to select *All Projects* in the *Projects* drop-down to see the installed operator.

. Switch to *NMState* tab and ensure it is in available status.

== Create Linux Bridge on Worker Nodes

Worker nodes have an extra network interface that is connected to a physical network.
To configure the physical network, you need to create a new custom resource whose _kind_ is NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy.

. In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to *Administration* -> *CustomResourceDefinitions*:
+

. In the *Search by name* field, type `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy`:
+
image::_images/Networking/11_NodeNetworkConfigurationPol.png[]

. Click `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` and navigate to the *Instances* tab:
+
image::_images/Networking/12_nodenetworkconfigurationpolicies.png[]

. Click *Create NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy*:
+
image::_images/Networking/13_Create_NNCP.png[]

. Click on *Edit YAML*.
. Copy and paste the following content into the editor:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: br-flat
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
  desiredState:
    interfaces:
      - name: br-flat
        description: Linux bridge with enp3s0 as a port
        type: linux-bridge
        state: up
        ipv4:
          dhcp: false
          enabled: false
        bridge:
          options:
            stp:
              enabled: false
          port:
            - name: enp3s0
----
+
This configuration uses the `enp3s0` interface on the worker nodes to create a Linux Bridge called `br-flat`.

. Click *Create*.

. Click on the *YAML* tab, scroll down and wait for the condition to read *3/3 nodes successfully configured*.
. Click *Cancel*.

== Create Network Attachment Definition

In order to use the Linux Bridge with your VM you need to create a *Network Attachment Definition*. This is what tells OpenShift about the network and allows the virtual machines to connect to it. Network Attachment Definitions are specific to the project/namespace they're created in, unless they're created in the `default` project. This gives you, the administrator, the ability to control which networks are and aren't available to users who have access to manage their own Vms. Once the Network Attachment Definition has been created, it can then be used by virtual machines when configuring their network adapters.

[NOTE]
Due to time constraints, the host network has already been configured in this lab. If you want to learn more about the host networking, along with how to view and manage the configuration, please use the NMState documentation found https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-observing-node-network-state.html[here].

. Navigate to *Networking* -> *Network Attachment Definitions* and click *Create network attachment definition*:
+

. IMPORTANT: Select project `vmexamples`

. Complete the form for the `vmexamples` project as follows, then click *Create*:
* *Name*: `flatnetwork`
* *Network Type*: `CNV Linux Bridge`
* *Bridge Name*: `br-flat`
+
image::_images/Networking/02_NAD_Create.png[]

. Examine the details of the network attachment definition:
+
image::_images/Networking/03_NAD_Created.png[]

. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines*, select the `fedora02` VM. Click *Configuration* tab and then click the *Network Interfaces* subtab:
+
image::_images/Networking/04_VM_Network_Tab.png[]

. Click *Add Network Interface*, complete the form as shown, then click *Save*.
+
Because this is a bridge connecting to the external network, we don't need to rely on any OpenShift features or capabilities to enable access, such as masquerade (NAT) for the virtual machines using the network. As a result, *type* should be `Bridge` here.
+

. Use the *Actions* menu to restart the VM. After rebooting, navigate to the *Console* tab:
+
image::_images/Networking/06_VM_Network_Console.png[]
+
The `eth1` interface obtains an IP address from the student network (192.168.3.x/24). That network has a DHCP server providing IPs to the network.

. (Optional) Use the console available in the right pane to test connectivity
+
.. Type the following command replacing the IP
+
[%nowrap]
----
 [~] $ curl 192.168.3.118:22                           
----
+
[NOTE]
Replace the IP which the IP assigned to the VM.
+
.Sample Output

== Summary

In this lab, you connected a VM to a physical network using a Linux Bridge so that it is accessible outside the cluster of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
